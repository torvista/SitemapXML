This Script generates a Sitemap as described here:

Upgrading this to ZenCart 1.5.7 and php7.4 was not easy.  I'm still in the process of following code flow.  I was considering adding XML template builders for Auctions and Maps, but I did not see anything new in Google instructions.  Still looking.

## Disclaimer
You download and use at your own risk and all that shit...
I don't have a business in web design and so have no need to degrade code for older stores or bad versions of PHP. 
There are others who do have a business and provide such support.

## Site Map XML files
Still reading up on the standard format of the xml files to see what else can be added.  If you know of other tags we can add, speak up.

Current XML setup for everything is

  <url>
  <loc>https:// URL /index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=72</loc>
  <lastmod>2020-05-22T03:54:02-07:00</lastmod>
  <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
  <priority>1.00</priority>
  <image:image>
   <image:loc>https:// URL /images/large/maps/AZ_TNM_Quads_LRG.jpg</image:loc>
  </image:image>
  </url>
  
Looking at adding ROR setup which for products is

 <Resource>
 <type>Product</type>
 <title>Name or Title of Product Two</title>
 <url>https:// URL /index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=72</url>
 <desc>Description of Product Two</desc>
 <keywords>keyword1, keyword2, keyword3</keywords>
 <image>https:// URL /images/large/maps/AZ_TNM_Quads_LRG.jpg</image>
 <imageSmall>https:// URL /images/maps/AZ_TNM_Quads.jpg</imageSmall>
 <price>19.95</price>
 <currency>USD</currency>
 <available>yes</available>
 </Resource>
 
 With a grater number of types Classified Ad, Auctions, maps would be nice..
